      " Prompt:\n",
      "Given context contains negative feedbacks from my team received during sprint retrospectives from days: 2023-01-02, 2022-12-16\n",
      "1. What common themes or patterns do you detect in the negative feedback provided over the different days?\n",
      "2. Highlight feedbacks from the same topic which appear most frequently?\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Common Themes or Patterns Detected:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Technical Issues and Bugs:** A significant portion of the feedback revolves around technical problems, such as high severity bugs in production, too many bugs in Jira/Confluence server, and the presence of 20+ bugs. This indicates a recurring issue with software quality and stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Process and Workflow Challenges:** Several comments highlight difficulties with the team's processes and workflows. This includes communication issues during sprint reviews, problems with the daily board (e.g., a huge mess on the daily board, inability to find tasks), and manual testing being too burdensome. There's also mention of tech debt meetings, suggesting ongoing concerns with managing technical debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Tool and Infrastructure Problems:** Feedback points to issues with the tools and infrastructure used by the team, such as problems integrating with Jira/Confluence server, guest access to features being confusing, and technical difficulties during remote meetings (e.g., turned off cameras, lags of audio, blurry video).\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Team Dynamics and Morale:** There are indications of negative impacts on team morale and dynamics, such as feeling overwhelmed, disappointment with the quality of content, and sadness about bugs not receiving proper attention. The mention of a smaller team due to the holiday period could also suggest challenges with resource allocation and workload distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feedbacks from the Same Topic Appearing Most Frequently:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Technical Issues and Bugs:** \n",
      "     - \"high severity bug found in production\"\n",
      "     - \"too many bugs in jira /conf server\"\n",
      "     - \"20+ bugs\"\n",

      "   - **Process and Workflow Challenges:**\n",

      "     - \"huge mess on daily board\"\n",
      "     - \"cannot find my task\"\n",
      "     - \"cannot find a task that we are talking about\"\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Tool and Infrastructure Problems:**\n",
      "     - \"feeling sad about the fact that we don't know how integration with jira/conf server works\"\n",
      "     - \"guest access to features is confusing\"\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Remote Meeting Difficulties:**\n",
      "     - \"turned off cameras\"\n",
      "     - \"lags of audio\"\n",
      "     - \"blurry video\"\n",
